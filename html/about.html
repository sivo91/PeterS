      <p> <strong>R</strong>etirement from sport found me in the USA where I successfully completed my twenty-plus years
        international career and now , I am preparing for the next chapter in my life in Information Technology.</p><br>
    
      <p>I am currently a student in Computer Information Science, scheduled to graduate next Spring( 2022 ). I divide my
        time among school, family life and a part time job.</p><br>
    
      <p>My goal is to remain productive member of our family and continue to achieve success in life, to become a leader
        and recognized expert in a new field. I admire computerized information technology because I believe itâ€™s going to
        play even greater role in our life than it does now , beyond one wildest imagination.</p><br>
    
      <p>The past twenty years had taught me how to succeed and shine in crowd, taught me resilience and discipline. I
        learned to fight for every moment and learn to keep winning momentum. My past career molded my hard working
        character and righteous personality. I am used to work under pressure and deliver consistent work in the least
        amount of time.</p><br>
    
      <p>These attributes allowed me to achieve success and win championships and numerous personal awards. Although, my
        previous career is over and it soon becomes a warm but distant memory, I look forward for a bright future and
        challenges that a field of computer science will bring.</p><br><br><br>
